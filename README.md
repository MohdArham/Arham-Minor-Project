## Configuration

1. Enable the module at Administration > Extend.
1. When creating a new field on a content type or custom entity type, choose
   "Double Field" from the drop-down menu.
1. On the Field Settings form for the Double Field, define the two subfields
   as you would with any other field.
1. Optionally, on the "Edit" form for the Double Field, you may choose
   options for whether or not the subfields are "required".

## Software Requirements
## Technology Used
## Languages
HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used for creating the structure and content of web pages. In the Student Helpdesk project, HTML is used to define the layout and structure of the web pages that make up the application. HTML tags are used to create elements such as forms, buttons, text fields, and other user interface components.

CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to add style and formatting to web pages. In the Student Helpdesk project, CSS is used to define the visual appearance of the web pages, including the colors, fonts, and layout. CSS stylesheets are linked to the HTML pages to apply the desired visual design.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactive features and behavior to web pages. In the Student Helpdesk project, JavaScript is used to validate form inputs, perform client-side data manipulation, and handle events such as button clicks and form submissions.

PHP: PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, and it is a server-side scripting language used for building dynamic web applications. In the Student Helpdesk project, PHP is used for handling server-side requests, processing form data, connecting to databases, and generating dynamic content.
## Hardware Requirments
## Recommended modules
## Troubleshooting

If the menu does not display, check the following:

- Are the "Access administration menu" and "Use the administration pages and
  help" permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?
- Does html.tpl.php of your theme output the `$page_bottom` variable?


## FAQ

**Q: I want to prevent robots from indexing my custom error pages by
setting the robots meta tag in the HTML head to "noindex".**

**A:** There is no need to. **Customerror** returns the correct HTTP
status codes (403 and 404). This will prevent robots from indexing the
error pages.

**Q: I want to customize the custom error template output.**

**A:** In your theme template folder for your site, copy the template
provided by the **Customerror** module
(i.e. `templates/customerror.html.twig`) and then make your
modifications there.

**Q: I want to have a different template for my 404 and 403 pages.**

**A:** Copy `customerror.html.twig` to
`customerror--404.html.twig` and `customerror--403.html.twig`. You
do not need a `customerror.html.twig` for this to work.
