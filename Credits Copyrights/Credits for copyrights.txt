The first two lines of the code contain links to external style sheets that are used to style the web page. The first link points to the Swiper JS library, which provides a mobile touch slider and framework for building responsive websites. The second link is for Font Awesome, a popular icon set that provides a library of icons and social media logos.

The next line of code includes an "img" tag with the "src" attribute and the "alt" attribute. This tag is used to insert the Jamia Hamdard logo into the web page. The "src" attribute specifies the location of the image file, while the "alt" attribute provides an alternative text description of the image.

The following lines of code include several social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube. Each icon is represented using an "a" tag with the "href" attribute set to the corresponding social media profile URL. The Font Awesome icon class is used to style each icon, with the "target" attribute set to "_blank" to open the links in a new tab.

The next section of code is the footer, which includes a copyright notice and credit to Mohd Arham. The "div" tag with the "class" attribute is used to create a separate section for the footer. Within the footer, the "span" tag is used to style the author's name.

Finally, the code imports the Rubik font from Google Fonts using the "@import" rule with the "url" attribute set to the Google Fonts URL. The Rubik font is available in multiple weights and is displayed using the "font-family" property.
